# PolyPoly
Is a Unity 3D Game with multiplayer using mirror (A Unity Networking Library). 
All assets were created by me using blender.
It also uses a third party UI System called Noesis (A Xaml based UI Toolkit)

For easier development using Mirror I added a modified Package called ParrelSync, letting the Developer have multiple editor instance open to test multiplayer with.

It contains two scenes:
 - FirstPersonDemo - Showcasing multiplayer and first person movement
 - GodViewDemo - Showcasing a basic city builder 
 
Before starting the project you have to first create Symlink for the NoesisUI to work.
Simply run the link.bat found in /Assets/UI/ as an adminstrator
